/*
  That is all it takes to implement a very basic feature in the Composable Architecture.
 
  There is of course a lot more to know about, such as executing effects and feeding data back into the system, using dependencies in reducers, composing multiple reducers together, and a lot more. 
  But we will stop here for this feature right now and move onto the view.

/*
 < Section 2 - Integrating with SwiftUI >
 
 Now that we have a simple feature built as a reducer, we need to figure out how to power a SwiftUI view from that feature. 
 This involves two new concepts: 'Store', which represents the runtime of the feature, and 'ViewStore', which represents the observation of the runtime.
 */

// View stores require that State be Equatable, so we must do that first. Once the view store is constructed we can access the featureâ€™s state and send it actions when the user taps on buttons.
extension CounterFeature.State: Equatable {}

struct CounterView: View {
    
    // That is generic over the reducer.
    // The 'Store' represents the runtime of your feature.
    // it is the object that can process actions in order to update state, and it can execute effects and feed data from those effects back into the system.
    // Tip - The store can be held onto as a let. It does not need to be observed by the view.
    // Note - You cannot read state from a Store directly, nor can you send actions to it directly. So, for now we will provide stubs for that behavior, but once a ViewStore is added we can provide the real implementations.
    let store: StoreOf<CounterFeature>
    
    // With some basic view scaffolding in place we can now start actually observing state in the 'store'. This is done by constructing a 'ViewStore', and for SwiftUI views there is a convenience view called a 'WithViewStore' that provides a lightweight syntax for constructing a view store.
    
    var body: some View {
        // Tip - Currently we are observing all state in the store by using observe: { $0 }, but typically features hold onto a lot more state than what is needed in the view. See our article Performance for more information on how to best observe only the bare essentials a view needs to do its job.
