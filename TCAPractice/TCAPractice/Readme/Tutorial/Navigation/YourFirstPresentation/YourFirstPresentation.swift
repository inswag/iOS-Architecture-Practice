 < Section 1 - Project set up >
 
 * Introduction
  - Suppose that you are working on an application that shows a list of contacts at the root, and you want to add the ability to create a new contact. This should be done by tapping a “+” icon in the UI, a sheet will be presented where you can enter the contact’s info, and then tapping a button will dismiss the sheet and add the contact to the list.
