  * Multiple presentation destinations
   - In the previous section you learned how model your domains so that a parent feature can present a child feature. Now let’s learn what has to be done if a parent feature wants to be able to present many features.
 
  < Section 1 - Delete contacts >
   * Introduction
    - Let’s add a new feature to the contacts list that allows you to delete a contact, but first you must confirm deletion. We will implement the confirmation step using an alert. The tools that we used last section, such as 'PresentationState', 'PresentationAction' and 'ifLet', all work for presenting alerts from optional state too.
