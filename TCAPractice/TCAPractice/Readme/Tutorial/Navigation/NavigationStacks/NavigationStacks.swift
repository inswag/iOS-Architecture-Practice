 < Navigation - Navigation stacks >
 
 * Introduction
  - We will continue with the contacts application built in previous sections.
   * adding a navigation stack to the root of the application so that we can drill down to a contact.
 
 
 < Section 1 - Contact detail feature >
  * We are going to add a new “Contact Detail” feature that will allow us to drill down a layer from the contacts list at the root.
 
 < Section 2 - Drill-down to contact detail >
  * Now that a new “Contact Detail” feature has been built we will make it possible to. drill down to it from the main list of contacts.
 
 < Section 3 - Deleting a contact >
  * We now have some drill-down functionality in our contacts app, but currently there is no interaction between the detail screen and the contacts list. Let’s change this by allowing you to delete a contact from the detail screen. We will first prompt the user with an alert asking them to confirm deletion, just as we did in Multiple presentation destinations.
